# Maze_Path
## **Finding path through maze using Backtracking** **UPDATED**

###### Setup:
- Have `Python 3` and `pygame` installed.
- Place the `app.py` and `presets.py` in the same folder.

###### Usage:

- Run the `app.py` to start the app.
- Use left click to add walls and right click to remove walls (Grey color indicates walls).
- Top left corner is starting position and bottom left corner is the ending position.
- Reset the maze by pressing R.
- Start the algorithm by pressing Spacebar(~~DO NOT PRESS ANYTHING WHILE IT IS FINDING THE PATH, it will hang~~ No more lag :D)
- It will find *ALL* the possible paths(This is important, if there are way too many paths available, it will take a lot of time to calculate).
- After it has found all paths, it will display the shortest path in Bright Green color.
- There are two presets available, press 1 or 2 to apply them.
